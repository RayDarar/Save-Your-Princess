<h3>A simple rogue-like game</h3>

<p>This was the project for "Algorithms and Programming" course in SDU (Almaty/Kazakhstan) university.</p>
<p>Main purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test my basic python knowledge</li>
  <li>Experience game dev via pygame</li>
</ul>

Gameplay:
<ul>
  <li>You're playing as a hero that has lost his own soul</li>
  <li>The goal is, to save princess and also retrieve your soul back from the demons</li>
  <li>To finish this, you need to fight 4 bosses: light soul, dark soul, gray soul, soul king</li>
  <li>In the beginning, you aren't strong enough to defeat all the demons, therefore there's a bunch of random souls from whose you can become a true hero</li>
  
  <li>While fighting, you have 4 active skills: 1 healing, 2 damage/armor buff, 3 critical hit, 4 ordinary hit</li>
</ul>

Good Luck!

p.s. There's a cheat code to defeat all the creatures instantly, just press 0 while fighting
